    <div><h2>Description</h2></div>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish originating from Rome. It is characterized by its simple yet rich sauce made from three primary ingredients: pecorino romano cheese, cured pork (guanciale is traditional, though pancetta is sometimes used), and egg yolk. The raw eggs are emulsified with the hot pasta and melted pork fat (not cream) to create a smooth, creamy coating. It is traditionally seasoned with generous amounts of black pepper.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Cured Pork & Egg Mixture: Cut guanciale (or pancetta) and cook until crisp; then, mix egg yolks with grated Pecorino Romano cheese and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook Pasta: Boil spaghetti or bucatini until al dente and reserve some of the starchy pasta water.</li>
        <li>Combine Fat and Pasta: Transfer the hot pasta to the pan with the warm pork fat.</li>
        <li>Emulsify Sauce: Remove the pan from the heat, quickly stir in the egg and cheese mixture, adding a splash of pasta water to create a creamy emulsion (the eggs should not scramble).</li>
        <li>Serve: Plate immediately and top with extra Pecorino and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
